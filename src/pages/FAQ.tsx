    question: "What services does AltruisticXAI offer?",
    answer: "We specialize in quantum computing readiness, AI deployment, policy compliance consulting, and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) migration. We help organizations navigate the intersection of emerging technologies and regulatory requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a typical pilot project take?",
    answer: "Our pilot projects typically run 8-12 weeks from initial assessment to deliverable. We focus on rapid prototyping and practical results that can be implemented immediately."
  },
  {
    question: "Who are your typical clients?",
    answer: "We work with government agencies, research institutions, municipalities, and forward-thinking enterprises preparing for quantum and AI transformation. Our clients range from public sector organizations to innovative startups."
  },
  {
    question: "What is post-quantum cryptography (PQC)?",
    answer: "Post-quantum cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms that are secure against attacks from quantum computers. As quantum computing advances, current encryption methods will become vulnerable. PQC migration is essential for long-term data security."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide training for our team?",
    answer: "Yes! We offer hands-on training and knowledge transfer as part of every engagement. Our goal is to empower your team to continue the work after our pilot project concludes."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes your approach different?",
    answer: "We operate as a living laboratoryâ€”every project is an experiment that contributes to our evolving framework. We focus on practical, implementable solutions rather than theoretical consulting. We learn with you."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get started?",
    answer: "Contact us through our booking form to schedule a strategy session. We'll discuss your needs, assess your readiness, and propose a tailored pilot project timeline."
  },
  {
    question: "What industries do you serve?",
    answer: "We work across government, healthcare, finance, defense, research institutions, and any sector facing quantum or AI compliance challenges. Our framework adapts to various industry requirements."
